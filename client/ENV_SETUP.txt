# Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory with the following content:

```
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:4000
VITE_ENV=development
```

## Explanation

- `VITE_API_BASE`: The base URL of your backend API server
  - Default: `http://localhost:4000` (matches default backend port)
  - Change this if your backend runs on a different port or domain

- `VITE_ENV`: Environment mode
  - `development`: Development mode (enables MSW mocking if configured)
  - `production`: Production mode

## Important Notes

1. Vite requires the `VITE_` prefix for environment variables to be exposed to the client
2. Never commit `.env` file with sensitive data
3. Use `.env.example` as a template for other developers
4. In production, set these via your hosting platform's environment variable settings
